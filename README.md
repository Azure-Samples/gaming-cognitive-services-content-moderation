# Content Moderation for Gaming - Reference Architecture

Not everyone behaves appropriately while they are playing online, and some moderation is needed to maintain a civil, welcoming, and pleasurable experience amongst the players. By detecting inappropriate messaging content generated by the community and pruning or deleting it before it is shown to the public view, you can help achieve this goal.

## Deploy

To deploy the reference architecture to your own account, use the button below.
